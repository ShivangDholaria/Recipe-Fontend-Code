<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

- NodeJS and NPM

Check if your system has [NPM and NodeJS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-download-and-install-node-js-and-npm/) and installed using the following command.
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
<h3>Setting up project</h3>

Clone the repository and move into the client folder using the following commands: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShivangDholaria/Recipe-App.git
cd ./Recipe-App/client
```

Run the following command to start the project locally:

```bash
 npm install 
 npm start
```

Make sure that the backend is up and running before starting the frontend as it might not work appropriately. 

Once the project is up and running you should be able to see the following on screen:
